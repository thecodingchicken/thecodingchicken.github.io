## Stuff to do in the future

- The clock of the 74hc138's in the register module need to be hooked up to the inverted clock signal.
- Hook up control lines for the ram in/ram out.  000 is disconnected, but 001-006 are connected up, where 001-006 are left-right.

### Thoughts for the future
- Use enamel wire to display contents of all registers?
