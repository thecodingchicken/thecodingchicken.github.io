## Ram

I'm going to be using a 62256-70 32kx8 ram chip, as that'll be plenty of ram for the program to use.  
For the MAR, I'm going with two 74hc377's, although 74hc574's would work just as well.  But I already bought a bunch of the 377's so I might as well use them, LOL.

That was the end of the day LOL
