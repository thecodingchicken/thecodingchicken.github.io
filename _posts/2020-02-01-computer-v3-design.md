## The Future

### 5-29-2025

I'm writing this early, as I was looking up some chips today for some reason and found [this chip](https://www.digikey.com/en/products/detail/alliance-memory-inc/AS6C4008-55PIN/4499026) and it's [datasheet](https://www.alliancememory.com/wp-content/uploads/AS6C4008.pdf).

It's a 4Mbit (512Kx8) ram chip, which should do quite nicely for the next version of the computer.  For that one, I think I'll finally migrate to pcb's as otherwise it would be nearly impossible.  However, I want to make it as Ben-Eater-like as possible, so it'll be in a bunch of modules with a couple backplanes and stuff.  It'll be a fun challenge.

I think this next iteration will be a true 16 bit computer, with vga, ethernet, ps/2 support, the whole nine yards.  I'm looking forward to it.  But back to the present and working on the SAP-2.  :-)
