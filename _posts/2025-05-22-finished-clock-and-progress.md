## Finishing the clock

I finally finished the clock, it was really just hooking up the logic gates and the third 555 timer.  Now that that's done, I can now do basic clock stuff.  However, there's not much that I can see with it as I don't have the ALU stuff hooked up.  

I've also decided to upgrade the main bus to 16 bits, as I have plenty of breadboards, and it really doesn't bother me.  If anything, that'll allow me to potentially expand this to 16 bits if I ever feel like causing that much pain and stuffering.  That would be a total redesign of a bunch of parts, like the ram, alu, and registers, but I _might_ do it.  
The main advantage of that is that it makes some instructions easier, like the program counter in/out, instruction register in/out(maybe), and that's about it.  
But that might be a fun challenge for the future.

Enough about the future, we're stuck in the present(always).  
I don't want to hook things up to the bus just yet, as I don't have a board ready.  But I might measure it up soon and buy something from home depot, as they should be able to cut it for me.  I just don't know the final height of it, as I know I need more breadboards below.  Need to prioritize that asap(nevermind that the left half of the pc isn't even wired up!  )
