## Work, planning for the future, and breadboards.

Like most of us, my day was partly taken up with work, and I got back after lunch, only to occupy myself with opening up a ton of packages of stuff I'd ordered for this project.  However, it's currently 11:34pm, and I need to leave before it gets too late tomorrow morning.  As such, tomorrow will hopefully be a bit longer, and I will have more time to do stuff.  

But here you go, lots of breadboards.  These suckers were expensive, but I wanted only the best for this project.

I'm going to order some more parts in the next few weeks and start building modules.  I haven't figured out exactly how I want to do it, and if I want leds for every module right there in the module, but we'll see.  Might try something special.  
I think there'll be another [Basic Design Goals](https://thecodingchicken.github.io/2025/04/24/some-basic-design-goals.html) blog coming up soon, but this next one will be more focused on the immediate future, i.e. Clock, registers, alu, other math features.  Def gonna do things differently.
