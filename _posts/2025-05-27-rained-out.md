## Rained out

Went out to work this morning, knowing that it was going to rain a little bit....yeah no.  We're back at the hotel, so I guess I get to work on the project more.  I also don't have internet at the hotel, because the wifi's down.  Ha!  But I have a couple datasheets loaded right now and I can download more if I have to.
