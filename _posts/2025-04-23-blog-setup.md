## Blog setup

Hello!  This is me, at 11pm, before I need to get up at 5 or so for work.  Going to write a couple things down here real quick about the future of this blog.

---

### Goals

 - Document the whole process of me building my next breadboard computer, inspired from [Ben Eater's SAP-1 Design](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HyznrdDSSGM&list=PLowKtXNTBypGqImE405J2565dvjafglHU).
 - Talk about design choices, features, how the architecture is planned, limitations, etc
 - Not go insane, while also going insane

Now, I have a whole lot on my mind, but I think the rest is probably better explained after work, and not right before bed, although those times should probably be closer than they are.
